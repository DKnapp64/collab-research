## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)

in_vswir_file = "~/Desktop/NCEAS_Workshop_2018/patch44_20170905_test3_rb_img"
in_csv <- "~/Desktop/NCEAS_Workshop_2018/44points.csv"
img <- stack(in_vswir_file)
extimg <- extent(img)
ulx <- extimg[1]
lrx <- extimg[2]
uly <- extimg[4]
lry <- extimg[3]

outfile <- "reef44_spectra_points.csv"

outdata <- raster::extract(img, pointframe[,c("X", "Y")])
combined <- cbind(pointframe, outdata)
write.csv(combined, outfile)

```
